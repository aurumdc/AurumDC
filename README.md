## Aurum Digital Currency
## Secure and Scalable Digital Assets Designed to Mimic Physical Currency

This repository will contain the source code for a prototype version of an Aurum Digital Currency system described in the paper *Designing Currency* by [Leonard Adleman](https://www.usc.edu/dept/molecular-science/fm-adleman.htm) and Rolfe Schmidt.  The repository will include all code used to produce experimental results in the paper.

The code will be released when the paper is published. If you need access to the source code sooner, or would like to know more about the Aurum system, please contact [Rolfe Schmidt](mailto:rolfe@alumni.princeton.edu).
